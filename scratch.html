        <p> My partner Deo and I have created a game called <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/173451594/"> Dungeon Master</a>, this game is a platformer and has several levels with a boss fight at the end. </p>

    <p>We created this code for our main character, Finn, which the player controls. We included code in order to create a jumping mechanic, and to create doors to progress to the next stages.</p>

    <p>We also created code for our other characters such as the boss at the end which the player has to defeat. We created the code which allowed the boss to appear when neccesary and have health which allows him to be defeated.</p>
