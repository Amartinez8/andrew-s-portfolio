        <p> This next project was a remix of a template project called <a target="_blank" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/172825734/"> Remix this dance 2</a>, this was remixed by my partner Jonathan "jon jon" and I. We added two different faces which were Mitt Romney and Barack Obama and made them dance to a make up rap battle made by epic rap battles of history.</p>

    <p>We kept the same code which allowed the arrow keys to be pressed in order to make the model look as if it is dancing.</p>
