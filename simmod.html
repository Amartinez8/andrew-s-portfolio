          <p>The next project my partner Tyler and I had to do was to take an existing simulation and modify it in some way. My partner and I took the simulation for fire burning in a forest and added rocks in order to stunt the growth of the fire in some locations. The first picture of the simulation contains the original code while the second pic contains the modified code shown.</p>
